# Amazon Chime SDK for Android

> Note: If building with the SDK source code, the `development` branch contains bleeding-edge changes that may not build with the publically available Chime media library or may not be as stable as [public releases](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-android/releases).

## Build video calling, audio calling, and screen sharing applications powered by Amazon Chime.

The Amazon Chime SDK for Android makes it easy to add collaborative audio calling,
video calling, and screen share viewing features to Android applications by 
using the same infrastructure services that power meetings on the Amazon 
Chime service.

This Amazon Chime SDK for Android works by connecting to meeting session
resources that you have created in your AWS account. The SDK has everything
you need to build custom calling and collaboration experiences in your
Android application, including methods to: configure meeting sessions, list 
and select audio devices, switch video devices, start and stop screen share 
viewing, receive callbacks when media events occur such as volume changes, 
and manage meeting features such as audio mute and video tile bindings.

To get started, see the following resources:

* [Amazon Chime](https://aws.amazon.com/chime)
* [Amazon Chime Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/what-is-chime.html)
* [Amazon Chime SDK API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)
* [SDK Documentation](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/)

And review the following guides:

* [Getting Started](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-android/blob/master/guides/01_Getting_Started.md)

## Setup

> NOTE: If you just want to run demo application, skip to [Running the demo app](#running-the-demo-app)

To include the SDK binaries in your own project, follow these steps.

For the purpose of setup, your project's root folder will be referred to as `root`

### 1. Download binaries

Download the following zips:

* [amazon-chime-sdk-0.7.2.tar.gz](https://amazon-chime-sdk-android.s3.amazonaws.com/sdk/0.7.2/amazon-chime-sdk-0.7.2.tar.gz)
* [amazon-chime-sdk-media-0.6.2.tar.gz](https://amazon-chime-sdk-android.s3.amazonaws.com/media/0.6.2/amazon-chime-sdk-media-0.6.2.tar.gz)

Unzip them and copy the aar files to `root/app/libs`

### 2. Update gradle files

Update `build.gradle` in `root` by adding the following under `repositories` in `allprojects`:

```
allprojects {
   repositories {
      jcenter()
      flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
      }
   }
}
```

Update `build.gradle` in `root/app` and add the following under `dependencies`:

```
implementation(name: 'amazon-chime-sdk', ext: 'aar')
implementation(name: 'amazon-chime-sdk-media', ext: 'aar')
```

Update `build.gradle` in `root/app` under `compileOptions`:

```
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

## Running the demo app

> NOTE: This is just to run demo application and use SDK as code instead of aar library. 

To run the demo application, follow these steps.

> NOTE: Please make sure that you are running on ARM supported devices (real devices) or simulator with arm supported. We do not support x86 currently, so simulators with x86 will not work.

### 1. Deploy serverless demo

Deploy the serverless demo from [amazon-chime-sdk-js](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js), which returns two urls `https://xxxxx.xxxxx.xxx.com/Prod/` and `https://xxxxx.xxxxx.xxx.com/Prod/v2/` 

Provide `https://xxxxx.xxxxx.xxx.com/Prod/` for mobile demo app.

### 2. Download binary

Download the following zip:

* [amazon-chime-sdk-media-0.6.2.tar.gz](https://amazon-chime-sdk-android.s3.amazonaws.com/media/0.6.2/amazon-chime-sdk-media-0.6.2.tar.gz)

Unzip and copy the aar files to `amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/libs`

### 3. Update demo app

Update `test_url` in `strings.xml` at the path `amazon-chime-sdk-android/app/src/main/res/values` 
with the URL of the serverless demo deployed in Step 1.

> NOTE: use `https://xxxxx.xxxxx.xxx.com/Prod/` instead of v2 url
