## Unreleased

### Custom Video Source
This release includes support for custom video sources, and therefore includes a lot of additional APIs.  Though most builders who have not been making modifications to internal render path should not need to make any changes and will not hit any compile time issues, there are some small breaking changes to certain render path APIs to ensure consistency within data flow across the SDK.  Recommendations are below, and all breaking changes should result in compile time errors (if you implemented the class yourself), if you continue to have difficulty resolving issues please cut an issue.

### Added
* Added new APIs in `RealtimeControllerFacade` to enable/disable Voice Focus (ML-based noise suppression) and get the on/off status of Voice Focus.
* Added Voice Focus feature in Android demo app.
* Added `VideoFrame`, `VideoRotation`, `VideoContentHint`, `VideoFrameBuffer`, `VideoFrameI420Buffer`, `VideoFrameRGBABuffer`, `VideoFrameTextureBuffer` classes, enums, and interfaces to hold video frames of various raw types.
* Added `VideoSource` and `VideoSink` to facilitate transfer of `VideoFrame` objects.
* Added `CameraCaptureSource`, `CaptureSourceError`, `CaptureSourceObserver`, `VideoCaptureFormat`, and `VideoCaptureSource` interfaces and enums to facilitate releasing capturers as part of the SDK.
* Added `DefaultCameraCaptureSource` implementation of `CameraCaptureSource`.
* Added `EglCore`, `DefaultEglCore`, `EglCoreFactory`, `DefaultEglCoreFactory`, `GlVideoFrameDrawer`, `DefaultGlVideoFrameDrawer`, `SurfaceTextureCaptureSource`, `DefaultSurfaceTextureCaptureSource`, `SurfaceTextureCaptureSourceFactory`, `DefaultSurfaceTextureCaptureSourceFactory`, for shared graphics related needs.
* Added `listVideoDevices` and `listSupportedVideoCaptureFormats` to `MediaDevice.Companion`.
* Added `SurfaceRenderView` and `TextureRenderView` an open source implementation of rendering onto a `SurfaceView` and `TextureView` respectively.
* Added `VideoLayoutMeasure` and `EglRenderer` + `DefaultEglRenderer` internal helper classes for use within aforementioned render views.
* Added more verbose logging from media layer to SDK layer for builders to control log level. Set `LogLevel` to `INFO` or above for production application to not be bombarded with logs..
* Added `getActiveAudioDevice` in `DefaultDeviceController` for API 24 or greater for developers to get currently used device

### Changed
* The render path has been changed to use `VideoFrame`s for consistency with the send side, this includes:
  * **Breaking** `VideoTileController.onReceiveFrame` now takes `VideoFrame?` instead of `Any?`.
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTileController` will have to update APIs correspondingly.
    * Currently the buffer type of all frames coming from the MediaSDK should be `VideoFrameI420Buffer` which should have the same API as the legacy, closed source buffer used.
  * **Breaking** `VideoTileController.initialize` and `VideoTileContoller.destroy` have been removed due to not being used.
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTileController` will have to remove APIs.
    * Previously these functions were called by internal `VideoClientController`, but now they no longer share state; if custom implementations need initialization, it must be done externally.
  * **Breaking** `VideoTile.renderFrame` now takes `VideoFrame` instead of `Any` and has been replaced by extending `VideoSink` and using `onReceivedVideoFrame`.
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTile` will have to update APIs correspondingly.
    * Currently the buffer type of all frames coming from the MediaSDK should be `VideoFrameI420Buffer` which should have the same API as the legacy, closed source buffer used.
  * **Breaking** `VideoTile.bind` no longer takes `bindParams: Any?` which was being used to inject `EGLContext` from internal classes.
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTile` will have to update APIs correspondingly, and add bind parameters outside of interface functions if necessary.
  * **Breaking** `VideoRenderView` is now just a `VideoSink` (i.e. it now accepts `VideoFrame` object via `VideoSink.onReceivedVideoFrame` rather then `Any?` via `render`).
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTile` will have to update APIs correspondingly.
    * Currently the buffer type of all frames coming from the MediaSDK should be `VideoFrameI420Buffer` which should have the same API as the legacy, closed source buffer used.
  * **Breaking** `VideoRenderView.initialize` and `VideoRenderView.finalize` have been abstracted away to `EglVideoRenderView` and are now named `init` and `release` respectively.
  * **Breaking** `DefaultVideoRenderView.setMirror` is now a class variable `mirror`.  `DefaultVideoRenderView.setScalingType` is now a class variable `scalingType`, and takes `VideoScalingType`
  * `DefaultVideoRenderView` now inherits from `SurfaceTextureView`.
* If no custom source is provided, the SDK level video client will use a `DefaultCameraCaptureSource` instead of relying on capture implementations within the MediaSDK; though behavior should be identical, please open an issue if any differences are noticed..
* Added additional, optional `id` (unique ID) parameter to `MediaDevice` for video capture devices.
* **Breaking** Changed the default log level of `ConsoleLogger` to `INFO` level from `WARN`.

### Fixed
* **Breaking** Changed behavior to no longer call `onVideoTileSizeChanged` when a video is paused to fix a bug where pausing triggered this callback with width=0 and height=0.
* Fix audio issue when using Bluetooth device by changing the sample rate to 16kHz.
* **Breaking** Fixed `listAudioDevices` to stop returning A2DP bluetooth devices, which are one way communication devices such as Bluetooth Speaker
* Fixed `videoTileDidAdd` not being called for paused tiles.

## [0.7.2] - 2020-09-01

### Fixed
* Fixed the issue that `listAudioDevices` does not return built-in handset for some devices
