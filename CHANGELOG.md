The Amazon Chime Service uses its active talker algorithm to select the top two active talkers, and sends their audio to Amazon Transcribe (or Amazon Transcribe Medical) in your AWS account. User-attributed transcriptions are then sent directly to every meeting attendee via data messages. Use transcriptions to overlay subtitles, build a transcript, or perform real-time content analysis. For more information, visit [the live transcription guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meeting-transcription.html).

* [Demo] Added meeting captions functionality based on the live transcription APIs. You will need to have a serverless deployment to create new AWS Lambda endpoints for live transcription.

* Changed AudioManager mode to be `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` only after builders call `audioVideo.start()`.
* Update text of additional options on demo app.
* Changes that support a speed up of video client initialization. `requestTurnCreds` callback will only be invoked as a backup for media layer logic. The signaling url is now passed into video client start. A new callback `onTurnURIsReceived` will be invoked when TURN uris are received by the client. This allows urls to be modified with urlRewriter or custom builder logic.
* Changed the demo app behavior so that when user starts/stops local video, the app does not switch to the Video tab automatically.

### Fixed
* Fixed potential concurrency issue on `VideoSourceAdapter`.

* Fix a bug that internal capture source was not stopped properly when the video client was being stopped.
* Fix camera capture start failure on certain Android devices when there are no FPS ranges at or below desired FPS max.

## [0.9.0] - 2020-12-17

### Added
* Added video pagination feature in the Android demo app. Remote videos will be paginated into several pages. Each page contains at most 4 videos, and user can switch between different pages. Videos that are not being displayed will not consume any network bandwidth or computation resource.

### Fixed
* Fixed a demo app issue that `SurfaceView` was not cleared up correctly when switching between Screen tab and Video tab.
* Fixed a demo app issue that `mirror` property was not reset when `VideoHolder` is recycled.
* Fixed rotation issue in demo app.

### Changed
* Refactored video view to resemble iOS UI so that video doesn't get cropped.
* **Breaking** Remove the internal video tile mapping entry not only when the video is *unbound*, but also when the video is *removed*. This fixes [`onVideoTileAdded(tileState)` is sometimes not called issue](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-android/issues/186), and provides better API symmetry so that builders no longer need to call `unbindVideoView(tileId)` if they did not call `bindVideoView(videoView, tileId)`.
  * After this fix, the internal video tile mapping entry will be removed before `onVideoTileRemoved(tileState)` callback is called. Please check your `VideoTileObserver`s and make sure your `onVideoTileRemoved(tileState)` handlers do not call any SDK APIs that depend on the existance of video tiles (e.g. `bindVideoView(videoView, tileId)`).

## [0.8.2] - 2020-12-11

## [0.8.1] - 2020-11-20

## [0.8.0] - 2020-11-17

### Custom Video Source
This release includes support for custom video sources, and therefore includes a lot of additional APIs.  Though most builders who have not been making modifications to internal render path should not need to make any changes and will not hit any compile time issues, there are some small breaking changes to certain render path APIs to ensure consistency within data flow across the SDK.  Recommendations are below, and all breaking changes should result in compile time errors (if you implemented the class yourself), if you continue to have difficulty resolving issues please cut an issue.

### Added
* Added new APIs in `RealtimeControllerFacade` to enable/disable Amazon Voice Focus (ML-based noise suppression) and get the on/off status of Amazon Voice Focus.
* Added Amazon Voice Focus feature in Android demo app.
* Added `VideoFrame`, `VideoRotation`, `VideoContentHint`, `VideoFrameBuffer`, `VideoFrameI420Buffer`, `VideoFrameRGBABuffer`, `VideoFrameTextureBuffer` classes, enums, and interfaces to hold video frames of various raw types.
* Added `VideoSource` and `VideoSink` to facilitate transfer of `VideoFrame` objects.
* Added `CameraCaptureSource`, `CaptureSourceError`, `CaptureSourceObserver`, `VideoCaptureFormat`, and `VideoCaptureSource` interfaces and enums to facilitate releasing capturers as part of the SDK.
* Added `DefaultCameraCaptureSource` implementation of `CameraCaptureSource`.
* Added `EglCore`, `DefaultEglCore`, `EglCoreFactory`, `DefaultEglCoreFactory`, `GlVideoFrameDrawer`, `DefaultGlVideoFrameDrawer`, `SurfaceTextureCaptureSource`, `DefaultSurfaceTextureCaptureSource`, `SurfaceTextureCaptureSourceFactory`, `DefaultSurfaceTextureCaptureSourceFactory`, for shared graphics related needs.
* Added `listVideoDevices` and `listSupportedVideoCaptureFormats` to `MediaDevice.Companion`.
* Added `SurfaceRenderView` and `TextureRenderView` an open source implementation of rendering onto a `SurfaceView` and `TextureView` respectively.
* Added `VideoLayoutMeasure` and `EglRenderer` + `DefaultEglRenderer` internal helper classes for use within aforementioned render views.
* Added more verbose logging from media layer to SDK layer for builders to control log level. Set `LogLevel` to `INFO` or above for production application to not be bombarded with logs..
* Added `getActiveAudioDevice` in `DefaultDeviceController` for API 24 or greater for developers to get currently used device

### Changed
* The render path has been changed to use `VideoFrame`s for consistency with the send side, this includes:
  * **Breaking** `VideoTileController.onReceiveFrame` now takes `VideoFrame?` instead of `Any?`.
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTileController` will have to update APIs correspondingly.
    * Currently the buffer type of all frames coming from the AmazonChimeSDKMedia library should be `VideoFrameI420Buffer` which should have the same API as the legacy, closed source buffer used.
  * **Breaking** `VideoTileController.initialize` and `VideoTileContoller.destroy` have been removed due to not being used.
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTileController` will have to remove APIs.
    * Previously these functions were called by internal `VideoClientController`, but now they no longer share state; if custom implementations need initialization, it must be done externally.
  * **Breaking** `VideoTile.renderFrame` now takes `VideoFrame` instead of `Any` and has been replaced by extending `VideoSink` and using `onReceivedVideoFrame`.
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTile` will have to update APIs correspondingly.
    * Currently the buffer type of all frames coming from the AmazonChimeSDKMedia library should be `VideoFrameI420Buffer` which should have the same API as the legacy, closed source buffer used.
  * **Breaking** `VideoTile.bind` no longer takes `bindParams: Any?` which was being used to inject `EGLContext` from internal classes.
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTile` will have to update APIs correspondingly, and add bind parameters outside of interface functions if necessary.
  * **Breaking** `VideoRenderView` is now just a `VideoSink` (i.e. it now accepts `VideoFrame` object via `VideoSink.onReceivedVideoFrame` rather then `Any?` via `render`).
    * Builders with a custom `VideoTile` will have to update APIs correspondingly.
    * Currently the buffer type of all frames coming from the AmazonChimeSDKMedia library should be `VideoFrameI420Buffer` which should have the same API as the legacy, closed source buffer used.
  * **Breaking** `VideoRenderView.initialize` and `VideoRenderView.finalize` have been abstracted away to `EglVideoRenderView` and are now named `init` and `release` respectively.
  * **Breaking** `DefaultVideoRenderView.setMirror` is now a class variable `mirror`.  `DefaultVideoRenderView.setScalingType` is now a class variable `scalingType`, and takes `VideoScalingType`
  * `DefaultVideoRenderView` now inherits from `SurfaceTextureView`.
* If no custom source is provided, the SDK level video client will use a `DefaultCameraCaptureSource` instead of relying on capture implementations within the AmazonChimeSDKMedia library; though behavior should be identical, please open an issue if any differences are noticed..
* Added additional, optional `id` (unique ID) parameter to `MediaDevice` for video capture devices.
* **Breaking** Changed the default log level of `ConsoleLogger` to `INFO` level from `WARN`.

### Fixed
* **Breaking** Changed behavior to no longer call `onVideoTileSizeChanged` when a video is paused to fix a bug where pausing triggered this callback with width=0 and height=0.
* Fix audio issue when using Bluetooth device by changing the sample rate to 16kHz.
* **Breaking** Fixed `listAudioDevices` to stop returning A2DP bluetooth devices, which are one way communication devices such as Bluetooth Speaker
