# API Overview

This guide gives an overview of the API methods that you can use to create a meeting with audio and 
video.

## 1. Create a session

The [MeetingSession](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.session/-meeting-session/index.html) and its [AudioVideoFacade](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-facade.html) are the starting points for creating meetings. 
You will need to create a [Logger](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.utils.logger/-logger/index.html) and [MeetingSessionConfiguration](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.session/-meeting-session-configuration/index.html) before creating a meeting
session.

### 1a. Create a logger

You can utilize the [ConsoleLogger](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.utils.logger/-console-logger/index.html) to write logs with Android's [Log](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log). You can also implement 
the Logger interface to customize the logging behavior.

```
val logger = ConsoleLogger(LogLevel.DEBUG) 
```

### 1b. Create a meeting session configuration

Create a [MeetingSessionConfiguration](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.session/-meeting-session-configuration/index.html) object with the responses to [chime:CreateMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html) and 
[chime:CreateAttendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html). Your server application should make these API calls and securely pass the 
meeting and attendee responses to the client application.

### 1c. Create a meeting session

Using the above objects and an application context, create a [DefaultMeetingSession](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.session/-default-meeting-session/index.html).

```
val meetingSession = DefaultMeetingSession(sessionConfig, logger, applicationContext)
```

## Configure the session

Before starting the meeting session, you should configure the audio device.

### 2a. Configure the audio device

To retrieve a list of available audio devices, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[listAudioDevices()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.device/-device-controller/list-audio-devices.html).

To use the chosen audio device, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[chooseAudioDevice(mediaDevice)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.device/-device-controller/choose-audio-device.html).

### 2b. Register a device change observer (optional)

You can receive events about changes to available audio devices by implementing a 
[DeviceChangeObserver](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.device/-device-change-observer/index.html) and registering the observer with the audio video facade.

To add a DeviceChangeObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[addDeviceChangeObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.device/-device-controller/add-device-change-observer.html).

To remove a DeviceChangeObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[removeDeviceChangeObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.device/-device-controller/remove-device-change-observer.html).

A DeviceChangeObserver has the following method:

* [onAudioDeviceChanged](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.device/-device-change-observer/on-audio-device-changed.html): occurs when audio devices are changed

## 3. Request permissions for audio and video

Before starting audio or video, you will need to request permissions from the user and verify that
they are granted. Otherwise, the API will throw a `SecurityException`. Amazon Chime SDK for Android 
already declares these permissions in its manifest file.

Audio permissions:
```
Manifest.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS,
Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO
```

Video permissions:
```
Manifest.permission.CAMERA
```

## 4. Register an audio video observer 

You can receive events about the audio session, video session, and connection health by implementing
an [AudioVideoObserver](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/index.html) and registering the observer with the audio video facade.

To add an AudioVideoObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[addAudioVideoObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/add-audio-video-observer.html).

To remove an AudioVideoObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[removeAudioVideoObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/remove-audio-video-observer.html).

An AudioVideoObserver has the following methods:

* [onAudioSessionStartedConnecting](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-audio-session-started-connecting.html): occurs when the audio session is connecting or reconnecting
* [onAudioSessionStarted](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-audio-session-started.html): occurs when the audio session has started
* [onAudioSessionStopped](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-audio-session-stopped.html): occurs when the audio session has stopped
* [onAudioSessionCancelledReconnect](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-audio-session-cancelled-reconnect.html): occurs when the audio session cancelled reconnecting
* [onConnectionBecamePoor](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-connection-became-poor.html) : occurs when connection health has become poor
* [onConnectionRecovered](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-connection-recovered.html): occurs when connection health has recovered
* [onVideoSessionStartedConnecting](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-video-session-started-connecting.html): occurs when the video session is connecting or reconnecting
* [onVideoSessionStarted](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-video-session-started.html): occurs when the video session has started
* [onVideoSessionStopped](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-observer/on-video-session-stopped.html): occurs when the video session has stopped

## 5. Starting and stopping the meeting session

Call this method after doing pre-requisite configuration (See previous sections). Audio permissions
are required for starting the meeting session. 

To start the meeting session, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[start()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/start.html). This will start underlying
media clients and will start sending and receiving audio.

To stop the meeting session, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[stop()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/stop.html). 

## 6. Building a roster of participants

### 6a. Register a realtime observer 

You can use a [RealtimeObserver](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-observer/index.html) to learn when attendees join and leave and when their volume 
level, mute state, or signal strength changes.

To add a RealtimeObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[addRealtimeObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-controller-facade/add-realtime-observer.html).

To remove a RealtimeObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[removeRealtimeObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-controller-facade/remove-realtime-observer.html).

A RealtimeObserver has the following methods:

* [onVolumeChanged](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-observer/on-volume-changed.html): occurs when attendees' volume level has changed
* [onSignalStrengthChanged](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-observer/on-signal-strength-changed.html): occurs when attendees' signal strength has changed
* [onAttendeesJoined](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-observer/on-attendees-joined.html): occurs when an attendee joins the meeting
* [onAttendeesLeft](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-observer/on-attendees-left.html): occurs when an attendee leaves the meeting
* [onAttendeesMuted](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-observer/on-attendees-muted.html): occurs when an attendee becomes muted
* [onAttendeesUnmuted](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-observer/on-attendees-unmuted.html): occurs when an attendee becomes unmuted

Note that only attendees whose volume level, mute state, or signal strength has changed will be 
included. All callbacks provide both the attendee ID and external user ID from [chime:CreateAttendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html) 
so that you may map between the two IDs.

### 6b. Register an active speaker observer (optional)

If you are interested in detecting the active speaker (e.g. to display the active speaker's video 
as a large, central tile), implement an [ActiveSpeakerObserver](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.audio.activespeakerdetector/-active-speaker-observer/index.html) and register the observer with 
the audio video facade.

You will also need to provide an [ActiveSpeakerPolicy](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.audio.activespeakerpolicy/-active-speaker-policy/index.html). You can use [DefaultActiveSpeakerPolicy](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.audio.activespeakerpolicy/-default-active-speaker-policy/index.html)
or implement the ActiveSpeakerPolicy interface to customize the policy.

To add an ActiveSpeakerObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[addActiveSpeakerObserver(policy, observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.audio.activespeakerdetector/-active-speaker-detector-facade/add-active-speaker-observer.html).

To remove an ActiveSpeakerObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[removeActiveSpeakerObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.audio.activespeakerdetector/-active-speaker-detector-facade/remove-active-speaker-observer.html).

An ActiveSpeakerObserver has the following methods:

* [onActiveSpeakerDetected](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.audio.activespeakerdetector/-active-speaker-observer/on-active-speaker-detected.html): occurs when an active speaker has been detected
* [onActiveSpeakerScoreChanged](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.audio.activespeakerdetector/-active-speaker-observer/on-active-speaker-score-changed.html): occurs periodically and provides the attendee's active speaker score

You can control `onActiveSpeakerScoreChanged`'s interval by providing a value for 
`scoreCallbackIntervalMs` while implementing ActiveSpeakerPolicy. You can prevent this callback
from occurring by using a null value.

## 7. Mute and unmute audio

To mute the local attendee's audio, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[realtimeLocalMute()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-controller-facade/realtime-local-mute.html).

To unmute the local attendee's audio, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[realtimeLocalUnmute()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.realtime/-realtime-controller-facade/realtime-local-unmute.html).

## 8. Share and display video

You can use the following methods in order to send, receive, and display video.

A [VideoTile](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile/index.html) is a binding of a tile ID, an attendee ID, that attendee's video, and a video view. 
The [VideoTileState](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-state/index.html) will contain further information such as if the video tile is for the local 
attendee. Video tiles start without a video view bound to it.

You can view content share the same way that you view a remote attendee's video. The video tile 
state will contain additional information to distinguish if that video tile is for content share.

### 8a. Sending video

Video permissions are required for sending the local attendee's video.

To start sending the local attendee's video, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[startLocalVideo()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/start-local-video.html).

To stop sending the local attendee's video, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[stopLocalVideo()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/stop-local-video.html).

### 8b. Getting and switching video device

When starting the local attendee's video, the underlying media client will use the active video 
device or the front facing camera if there is no active video device. You can use the following
methods to get or switch the active video device.

To get the active video device, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[getActiveCamera()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.device/-device-controller/get-active-camera.html).

To switch the active video device, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[switchCamera()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.device/-device-controller/switch-camera.html).

### 8c. Receiving video

To start receiving video from remote attendees, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[startRemoteVideo()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/start-remote-video.html).

To stop receiving video from remote attendees, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[stopRemoteVideo()](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/stop-remote-video.html).

### 8d. Adding a video tile observer

You will need to implement a [VideoTileObserver](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-observer/index.html) and register the observer with the audio video 
facade to receive video tile events for displaying video.

To add a VideoTileObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[addVideoTileObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-controller-facade/add-video-tile-observer.html).

To remove a VideoTileObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[removeVideoTileObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-controller-facade/remove-video-tile-observer.html).

A VideoTileObserver has the following methods:

* [onVideoTileAdded](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-observer/on-video-tile-added.html): occurs when an attendee starts sharing video
* [onVideoTileRemoved](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-observer/on-video-tile-removed.html): occurs when an attendee stops sharing video
* [onVideoTilePaused](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-observer/on-video-tile-paused.html): occurs when a video tile's pause state changes from Unpaused
* [onVideoTileResumed](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-observer/on-video-tile-resumed.html): occurs when a video tile's pause state changes to Unpaused

A pause or resume event can occur when the underlying media client pauses the video tile for 
connection reasons or when the pause or resume video tile methods are called.

The video tile state contains a [VideoPauseState](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-pause-state/index.html) to differentiate how the video tile was paused.

### 8e. Binding a video tile to a video view

To display video, you will also need to bind a video view to a video tile. Create a 
[VideoRenderView](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-render-view/index.html) and bind that view to the video tile in VideoTileObserver's `onVideoTileAdded` 
method. You can use [DefaultVideoRenderView](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-default-video-render-view/index.html) or customize the behavior by implementing the
VideoRenderView interface.

To bind a video tile to a view, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[bindVideoView(videoView, tileId)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-controller-facade/bind-video-view.html).

To unbind a video tile from a view, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[unbindVideoView(tileId)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-controller-facade/unbind-video-view.html).

### 8f. Pausing a remote video tile

To pause a remote attendee's video tile, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[pauseRemoteVideoTile(tileId)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-controller-facade/pause-remote-video-tile.html).

To resume a remote attendee's video tile, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[resumeRemoteVideoTile(tileId)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.video/-video-tile-controller-facade/resume-remote-video-tile.html).

## 9. Receiving metrics (optional)

You can receive events about available audio and video metrics by implementing a [MetricsObserver](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.metric/-metrics-observer/index.html)
and registering the observer with the audio video facade. Events occur on a one second interval.

To add a MetricsObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[addMetricsObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/add-metrics-observer.html).

To remove a MetricsObserver, call meetingSession.audioVideo.[removeMetricsObserver(observer)](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo/-audio-video-controller-facade/remove-metrics-observer.html).

A MetricsObserver has the following method:

* [onMetricsReceived](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-android/amazon-chime-sdk/com.amazonaws.services.chime.sdk.meetings.audiovideo.metric/-metrics-observer/on-metrics-received.html): occurs when metrics are received
